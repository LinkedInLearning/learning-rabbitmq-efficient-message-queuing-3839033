## Course Description

<p>RabbitMQ is one of the most popular open-source message brokers in use today. This lightweight software can help companies that have adopted a microservices model stitch together and enable communication between their services. In this hands-on course, join instructor Peter Morlion as he demonstrates how developers can properly install and work with RabbitMQ to create messaging applications.</p>
<p>After delving into the fundamental concepts behind message-based systems and the AMQP message protocol, Peter explains how to implement RabbitMQ as he steps through a sample application. He covers both basic usage, such as how to publish to and consume from a RabbitMQ exchange, as well as more advanced topics like setting up and using authentication in RabbitMQ. Whether you are configuring a new RabbitMQ instance or integrating it into existing systems, this course can equip you with the skills to build robust solutions for your enterprise applications.</p>

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
